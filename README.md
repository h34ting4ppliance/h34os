H34OS is an hobbyist project operating system fully programmed in Assembly x86 and with very awful optimization. I just code it as long as it works lmao
-----

At the time of writing, the 0.1 of the operating system is not done because the list of features isn't complete :
  - [X] Bootloader, reading and running code outside the boot sector
  - [X] Basic shell
  - [X] Some pretty user interface
  - [X] Text editor
  - [ ] File system
  - [ ] Programming language to make your own programs
  - [ ] Some fancy shell commands
 
 **This project can't be considered done until all of those features are done.**  
 Actually the operating system is working on 16-bits real mode and I am only using
 the actual Assembly knowledge I have for now.  
 
 A new version in 32-bits protected is planned, which is gonna be programmed mainly
 in C.
