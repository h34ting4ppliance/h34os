Just a simple OS that is literally useless.
-----

At the time of writing, the 0.1 of the operating system is not done because the list of features isn't complete :
  - [X] Bootloader, reading and running code outside the boot sector
  - [X] Basic shell
  - [X] Some pretty user interface
  - [X] Text editor
  - [ ] File system
  - [ ] Programming language to make your own programs
  - [ ] Some fancy shell commands
 
 **This project can't be considered done until all of those features are done.**
